# Flutter MCP Server

This project implements an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Flutter/Dart development, designed for deployment on Smithery and discoverability via the Smithery Registry. It exposes Dart/Flutter tools for AI-driven workflows and ensures secure handling of environment variables.

## Features
- Exposes Dart and Flutter SDK tools (analyze, format, fix, create, run, test)
- Supports MCP protocol for AI assistants
- Secure environment variable management
- Smithery Registry integration
- Ready-to-deploy Dockerfile and smithery.yaml for Smithery

## Documentation

- See the [`docs/`](docs/README.md) folder for detailed setup, tool descriptions, deployment, and AI client integration guides.
- See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Dart SDK (â‰¥3.4.4)
- Flutter SDK
- Docker (for local container builds and Smithery deployment)
