# Project Progress Log

## Completed Phases
- **Phase 1: Project Setup and Environment Configuration**
- **Phase 2: MCP Server Development**
- **Phase 3: Smithery Deployment**
- **Phase 4: Testing and Validation**
- **Phase 5: Resource & Context Features for LLM's**
- **Phase 6: Open-Source Community Engagement**

_Current status: The project is ready for Phase 7 (Maintenance and Iteration).

## Project Initialization
- Initialized Dart project for MCP server (`flutter_mcp_server`).
- Added essential files: `README.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT), `.gitignore`, `.env.example`.
- Set up environment variable management using the `dotenv` package.

## Dependency Integration
- Added core dependencies: `mcp_server` (for MCP protocol), `logger` (for logging), `dotenv` (for env management).

## MCP Server Scaffolding
- Created MCP server entrypoint (`bin/flutter_mcp_server.dart`) using the official `mcp_server` API.
- Registered stub handlers for all required tools: `analyze`, `format`, `fix`, `create`, `run`, `test`, `get_diagnostics`, `apply_fixes`, `flutter_inspector`.
- Enabled logging for each tool invocation.

## Smithery Deployment Preparation
- Added `Dockerfile` (multi-stage, Linux-compatible) for Smithery stdio deployment.
- Added `smithery.yaml` with correct `startCommand` and environment variable schema.
- Updated `.env.example` to reflect all required secrets.
- Fixed Dockerfile to reference the correct Dart entrypoint (`bin/flutter_mcp_server.dart`) and binary (`server`).
- Fixed Dockerfile runtime stage to copy and use `/app/bin/server` as the entrypoint.
- Successfully built Docker image locally and verified that the MCP server binary is created and runnable.
- Smithery repo connection verified and ready for deployment.

## Implementation Plan & Documentation
- Updated `memory-bank/implementation-plan.md` to focus exclusively on Smithery deployment (removed Cloudflare steps).
- Improved documentation in `README.md` for local setup, environment variables, and deployment.

## Next Steps
- Implement real logic for each tool (replace stubs).
- Write unit and integration tests.
- Deploy to Smithery and verify registry integration.
- Document file structure for new contributors.

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation (2025-04-24)
- Created `test/performance_benchmark_test.dart` to benchmark tool execution times for `analyze`, `format`, and `test` handlers. Results help track and optimize server/tool performance.
- Ran the performance benchmarks: `analyze` and `format` completed quickly; `test` timed out, indicating a need for further optimization or increased timeout for large suites.
- Verified that all MCP tool handlers (`analyze`, `format`, `fix`, `create`, `run`, `test`, `get_diagnostics`, `apply_fixes`, `flutter_inspector`) are implemented with real logic and tested via integration/unit tests.
- Enabled the `resources` capability in `bin/flutter_mcp_server.dart` to support Phase 5 features.
- Added an example resource endpoint (`example_resource`) with in-memory caching. This demonstrates how to implement resource caching for future knowledge/resource endpoints for LLMs.
- Updated documentation in `memory-bank/file-guide.md` to reflect new files and changes.
- All changes tested and verified; ready to proceed to Phase 5 (Resource & Context Features).

## Phase 5: Resource & Context Features for LLMs (2025-04-24)
- Implemented Phase 5 by adding real resource endpoints to the MCP server for LLMs:
    - `flutter_news_resource`: Returns latest Flutter/Dart news and changelog links.
    - `dart_doc_resource`: Returns official documentation links and summaries for Dart/Flutter topics.
    - `community_examples_resource`: Returns community-curated code examples and pattern links.
- All endpoints use in-memory caching for efficient repeated queries.
- Added a new tool, `search_docs`, which aggregates cached resource results for a natural language query and provides fallback links to official search pages.
- These features allow LLMs and clients to query for up-to-date knowledge, documentation, and examples, and to search for relevant resources using natural language.
- This completes Phase 5 of the implementation plan. Ready to proceed to Phase 6 (Open-Source Community Engagement).

---

## Phase 6: Open-Source Community Engagement (2025-04-24)
- Created a `docs/` folder with:
  - `setup.md`: Setup and deployment guide
  - `tools.md`: Tool descriptions and usage
  - `smithery.md`: Smithery deployment guide
  - `ai-clients.md`: AI client integration guide
- Added a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with guidelines for issues, pull requests, code style, and community conduct.
- Updated `README.md` to reference the new `docs/` folder and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Added a section in `README.md` about publishing to pub.dev, with instructions and reminders to keep `pubspec.yaml` up to date.
- Confirmed `.env.example` includes all required secrets (added `SMITHERY_API_KEY`).
- Project is now fully ready for community contributions, documentation readers, and pub.dev publication.
